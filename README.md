# conceptual-saliency

Preliminary work to explore the possibility to apply Formal Concept Analysis and Saliency Mapping to extract meaning from datasets.

## Repository Goals

- Implement and test various FCA algorithms on different datasets.
- Generate visualizations of the concept lattices and other FCA structures.
- Apply saliency mapping techniques to these visualizations to highlight key insights.
- Analyze and document the outcomes to refine the workflow and improve results.

## Repository Structure [TODO]

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with code and experiments.
- `data/`: Sample datasets used for testing.
- `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `results/`: Output visualizations and analysis results.
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources.
