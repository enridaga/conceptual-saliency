# Conceptual Saliency

This repository contains the code for the pipeline introduced in the paper "Towards Data Saliency for Knowledge Discovery. A Case Study in the Art Domain" by Giulia Renda, Enrico Daga, and Marilena Daquino. The study investigates the concept of data saliency and its application in knowledge discovery, particularly within the domain of art collections.

## Abstract

The paper explores the application of visual saliency concepts to data analytics, aiming to identify significant subsets of datasets that are representative or prominent. A novel approach is proposed, combining Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) with saliency mapping algorithms to automatically identify salient data clusters. The pipeline is tested using the Tate collection dataset, with user surveys conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the identified salient clusters.

## Methodology
1. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA):
   - FCA is used to produce deterministic and explainable clusters from the dataset.
   - Clusters are generated by transforming the data into a binary matrix and creating a formal context.
   - A concept lattice is constructed using the Sofia algorithm to manage scalability issues.
2. Data Visualisations:
   - Clusters are visualised through scatter plots, bar charts, and concept lattices.
   - These visualisations help in identifying the distribution and prominence of the data clusters.
3. Saliency Mapping:
   - Three saliency mapping algorithms (Vanilla Integrated Gradients, SmoothGrad Integrated Gradients, and XRAY) are applied to the visualisations.
   - These algorithms help in highlighting the most and least salient concepts.
4. User Survey:
   - A survey is conducted where participants rate the concepts based on their representativeness and prominence.
   - The survey results are used to validate the effectiveness of the saliency mapping.
