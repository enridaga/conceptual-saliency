    "Welcome to the **Formal Concept Saliency** notebook! This project aims to apply Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) algorithms to a dataset and analyze the resulting visualizations using saliency mapping techniques.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical technique used for data analysis, knowledge representation, and information retrieval. By utilizing FCA, we can extract meaningful patterns and relationships from complex datasets. Saliency mapping, on the other hand, helps in identifying the most significant parts of a visualization, aiding in better interpretation and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement and test various FCA algorithms on different datasets.\n",
    "- Generate visualizations of the concept lattices and other FCA structures.\n",
    "- Apply saliency mapping techniques to these visualizations to highlight key insights.\n",
    "- Analyze and document the outcomes to refine the workflow and improve results."
